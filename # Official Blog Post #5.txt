### I've just finished my second Twine-playing binge and have decided to ramble about games for this blog post.

After re-playing and exploring such Twine games as [Even Cowgirls Bleed by Christine Love](http://scoutshonour.com/cowgirl/), [Horse Master: The Game Of Horse Mastery by Tom McHenry](http://noncanon.com/HorseMaster.html), [Queers in Love at the End of the World, by Anna Anthropy](http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/), and [Depression Quest, by Zoe Quinn](http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html) I am in awe. I have been struck again, as I often am when I re-indulge in video games, by the creative possibilities that video games have to offer.  While they have all been created by using the same fairly simple platform, each one represents a unique experience, provokes a range of emotions, and engages a variety of different topics. And these topics are generally only found on the margins of gaming and mainstream gamer culture. You've got a dystopic horse training story that plays more as a condemnation of American machismo, the neo-liberal police state, celebrity culture, and the distancing that gaming exacerbates between humans and "nature." You've got a short, fleeting, and fatalistic moment of queer sexuality that can teach you a lot about yourself considering the amount time you'll actually spend playing the game. And you have a realstic and first-person textual experience of what it can be like to suffer depression.  They remind me of the dynamic nature of video games in ways that the games I've gotten used to playing (manistream, run of the mill first-person shooters) don't. Even the simplest of games and "engines" (I hope that this is the correct term to be using) have the capacity to be extremly imaginative, in the right hands. Not just that, but they are subversive, political, and critical in their own ways, implicitly and explicitly.

In their own unique ways they all play around with the traiditional tension that exists in games between free will/choice & a game's narrative and mechanical structures. For example, in Horse Master, a part from being narrative & leading, the game offers you a clever "out" regarding the most difficult part of game play with its super injector button (or whatever it was called). It is quite self aware as a game (referencing the spreadsheet nuts who do the math to achieve the perfect score), offering users the chance to skip what would typically be considered THE gameplay - upgrading your horse tactically and strategically to win - and go straight for the win. You have the free will and choice to go along with this, it feels wrong. In Anthropy's game it is the time dynamic that shakes up the free will vs structure. You have a relatively large amount options and paths that you can take, but you only have so long before the game resets. So while you can click on anynumber of things and you have plenty of options, you can't take much time to consider any of them or re-read them. Finally, in Depression Quest the crossed-out options are the most fascinating. They stand in for depression's very real power over people and over their (in)ability to act in a manner that they believe to be appropriate and healthy. You have many options every turn, but depending on how well you are doing certain options, options that seem the most helpful, are unavailable to you.

All in all, these games have made me fall in love once again with video games, and I will be exploring them well after the course ends.
