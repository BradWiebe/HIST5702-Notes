# On Zotero Tutorial 1
## For this to work on Windows you've got a few extra steps to go through first!
You want to enter `python -m pip install win_unicode_console` into the Command Line

After a successful install you will go into your Python interpreter with the simple command `Python`

Next you will want to import and enable, first with `import win_unicode_console` and then `win_unicode_console.enable()`

### Unicode will help your machine understand what we will be doing with Zotero and prevent the hiccups that Emily & I encountered with Professor Graham. Now you can follow the slightly different process outlined below to go through the Tutorial. There are a few nuances over when and how you input the commands shown by the tutorial

## Input the following commands on the Command Line in the Python interpreter. **This must be done right after you finished the Unicode process above (according to Graham the Unicode will not stick around and would have to be re-added if you close the Command Line)**

The Tutorial Commands for Windows are as follows (NOTE: capitalization matters and you should only be getting >>> after every command you put in unless otherwise stated):
* `from libZotero import zotero`
* `zlib=zotero.Library('group','155975','<null>','9GLmvmZ1K1qGAz9QWcdlyf6L')`
* `items = zlib.fetchItemsTop({'limit': 5, 'content': 'json,bib,coins'})`
     * At this point the Tutorial says you should have an output, but you should NOT.
* `for item in items:`
     * At this point the Tutorial says to include the rest of the command, but it should be included after!
* `     print 'Item Type: %s | Key: %s | Title: %s' % (item.itemType,item.itemKey, item.title)`
     * you need to include a series of 4 spaces before this `print` command. A series metadata should appear.
* `for item in items:`
     * At this point the Tutorial says to include the rest of the command, but it should be included after!
* `     print item.bibContent`
     * you need to include a series of 4 spaces before this `print` command. A series metadata should appear.

## SUCCESS


## (Notes prior to solution from Graham) Emily and I working together.
Have successfully installed Zotero with Pyton Interpreter and `python -m pip install libzotero`

Then copy/pasted:
`#make the libZotero library available
from libZotero import zotero` into a .py text file for python to go get, using the following command: `python -i zotero.py`

This led simply to Command Prompt displaying ▷▷▷. which is fine, means the command works and wants you to continue, you'll get an output later.
