## On (not so) Live Blogging & Open Notebooks
### In light of both our course discussions on Open Notebooks/up-to-date blogging and my half-hearted attempts to practice this (here and in other course settings), I have decided to use this post to come clean with some of my many problems and personal failures in this regard. For starters, I have always been a horrible note-taker by any standard: speed, comprehensiveness, legibility, comprehensibility, etc. My notes tend to be comprehensible at the time of writing and in the context of their production (i.e. course discussion, tutorial walk-through), but some how always end up being quite difficult to decipher. So the idea of presenting my raw notes openly on a public forum to anybody makes me immediately anxious. If I don't typically understand my own notes, how can I expect someone else to find them helpful? Beyond that, I sometimes find it hard to imagine that the notes will ever be useful to anyone anyway, despite the fact that from an historical perspective I firmly believe in the importance of all recordkeeping and that there is no way of foreseeing the value future audiences will ascribe documents & data. 

Not being able to publish the raw notes then, I require ample (read: A LOT) time to assess the notes, apply some quality-control to them (filling in some enormous gaps, correcting mistakes), and make them pretty. Having to do this hurts just how "live" or up-to-date they actually end up being, especially in combination with other academic and professional commitments that pop up and distract from good, proper note publishing. So in addition to the problems around providing clean, easy-to-understand, and helpful notes, scheduling and timing conflicts also become detrimental to the process. Cleaning up the notes, revisiting them while the are still fresh in your mind, publishing them as soon as possible can all get pushed back.

While up-to-date and open note- & workbooks are the ideal according to the philosophy of the course and they figure prominently with some of the issues that come up in seminar, they don't necessarily need to be the reality yet, for me or for others. There is obviously still some acceptable space for these problems to exist and play out. I just bring them up because I believe they are important to bear in mind when reading the rest of my blog posts and when embarking upon your own open projects that require regular check-ins and blogging. For me personally, the abovementioned problems continue to be an obstacle obstructing my full embrace of this method of working.


With all of that said and done however, there have been some noticeable benefits for me and my work. In at least attempting to embrace this philosophy and trying to abide by it, I have been forced to try and stop to think more deeply and more often during the whole process, mostly because in order to publish good notes/posts some further fleshing out of ideas is generally required. This leads to extra efforts on my part to refine, focus, and organize my thoughts; efforts that might not typically occur if I was to solely use my notes as a personal and private reference tool as opposed to openly accessible material. So there are some pros to this process apart from the laudible goal of open access. 


A part from explaining some of my feelings about the note-taking and recording elements of the class and what I've learnt from them, I also want to use this space to leave a couple of related, important notes about my blog posts in general. You may have already picked up on these if you have been following along. My posts were not exactly written/published live, chronologically, or progressively (i.e. a blog dedicated to each week or even each tutorial and specific topic explored in class). They have been built upon my former notes (available on my github, should you wish to explore), but there are primarily "after the fact." I hope that they are fruitful for you and for me nonetheless. As well, regarding the next post, it originally got erased because of an element in resophnotes that I did not take into account. I tried to recreate it word for word, but that didn't work because the info and even the subject became useless because my thinking changed and the subject of the post developped further and beyond what had been originally jotted down. Now is just collection of various things strewn together, written at different times, with different things in mind. Like my blogging as a whole, I like to call the next post's style the "time-travelling Frankenstein."
