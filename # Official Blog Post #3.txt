## On (not so) Live Blogging & Open Notebooks
### Problems with Resoph. Problems with my own notetaking (anxiety, quality-control, incomprehensible) leading to inability to fully embrace the note-taking/sharing philosophy of the course. But also, in embracing this philosophy/trying to abide by it, I have been forced to try and stop to think more deeply, but also to refine and focus my own thoughts (not entirely though, because I still need to make it publicly accessible and eacceptable)


A couple of important notes about my blog posts: Not exactly live, chronological, or progressive (i.e. a blog dedicated to each week or even each tutorial and specific topic explored in class). I hope that they are fruitful nonetheless (re:acceptable for assessment purposes)

Also, about the next one. It got erased. I tried to recreate it word for word, but that didn't work because the info and even the subject became useless because my thinking changed and the project developped further and beyond what had been originally jotted down. So the next you will see is a combination of things (like what?). It's a time-travelling Frankenstein. 


Your posts should/could reflect on the readings, the discussion, and what you learned from the session leader's experience that week. You should also be frequently posting regarding your final project as it develops
