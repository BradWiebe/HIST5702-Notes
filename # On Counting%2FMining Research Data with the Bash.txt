# On Counting/Mining Research Data with the Bash
## Apparently I will be able to do things Microsoft Excel could only dream of with the commands taught in this tutorial.

An important note in counting/mining: offering up lots of metadata and organizing in a consistent and logical matter help a lot. 

I have just downloaded the practice file that the tutorial will be teaching me to count and mine.
The 'wc' command counts things. > documents the results.

The 'grep' command (global regular expression print) is used to search across multiple files for specific strings of characters. Different flags allow for different things. -c again does the character count. -i does a case insensitive count. -v excludes. 

> allows for the "printing" of results.

I can create printouts of data with both .csv & .tsv files (notes vs. excel spreadsheets)


**NOTE**:
CSV: comma-separated-values
TSV: Tab-separated-values

WC: command for counting. combined with the flags -w, -l, -c for word, line, and character counts respectively. You can also use wc with a combination of wildcards and flags to build more complex queries

-v; excludes something from a search

DO NOT forget about the Cancel command, ctrl+c
