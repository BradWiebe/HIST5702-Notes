## On Tim Cresswell & Place
### As part of this year's Underhill Coloquium, the day after his address, keynote speaker Tim Cresswell facilitated a workshop for students on "Place" as a concept, a philosophy, a category of analysis, and as so much more. While in attendance, I reflected on the Coloquium's emphasis on place - or sites, to be more specific - as a concept which transcends physicality. Places & spaces can be constructed both in our minds and, of course, in virtual/digital worlds. Being very interested to hear what a prestigious scholar interested in Place like Cresswell thinks about the increasing power and ubiquity of virtual spaces (defined in any number of ways: 3D video games, social networks, etc.) I asked him about it during the workshop. Although we did not get very far into the tension between experiences and inhabitations of physical vs. ditigial spaces, or the vast migration of people from the latter to the former (i.e. many more people spending their time and living in digital spaces vs. physical), Cresswell and attendees had a number of (fairly broad) comments worth repeating (read: awkwardly paraphrasing) here and at least somewhat related to the conversations surrounding the themes of our course.

For instance, he emphasized the "mirroring" that virtual spaces undertake. That is to say that these spaces are often reflections of places that already exist and interactions & relationships in the "real world." New, constructed spaces add to, replace, or evolve already existing ones. That being said, Cresswell highlighted the fact that diversionary and experiential spaces - entertainment-based digital spaces - fulfill a specific role that set them apart from the "real-life" experience of space: eliminating minutia. Everyday interactions and relationships and aspects of life characterized as dull do not often find their way into digital spaces. Virtual experiences are almost always stimulating and bereft of boredom. From what I understood from Cresswell's speech, digital space (at least in certain places like video games and social meida) facilitates and is characterized by escapism.

On this topic and further into our discussion at the workshop, an attendee brought up the problem of virtual tourism and its legitimacy. The question was posed: are digital tourism and experiences the same as physical tourism? Obviously they are not the "same," but the authenticity and value of visiting a place virtually are important things for us to think about going forward. If you read Japanese literature online, enage with the people of Japan through the internet, watch go-pro videos from tourists walking in Japan, etc. have you been to Japan? Have you truly experienced Japan? And on the flip-side, if you have a 1 hour layover in a Japanese airport and are physically in the country, have you been to Japan? Have you experienced it? Which set of experiences is more authentic? The lines dividing the "authenticity" of either or are blurred, raising important questions about the future of virtual/digital realities and spaces. In a greener, more digitally connected globalized world, will virtual tourism and reality be the new norm? Or will there still be those demanding the physical, "authentic" experience?

Finally, we also touched on the supremacy and villainousness of Google and its control over people's digital journey, visibility, and footprints through location and activity recording. Power dynamics, market forces, and surveillance are becoming increasingly married to the digital and vice versa, meaning no matter where you find yourself geographically, if you are "on the grid" so to speak, your mobility and agency in both sets of Place are most likely tracked, analyzed, acted upon, and in some cases manipulated and controlled. Who controls "Place" - access, movement, information, shape & character, format, among many others - will become a more and more crucial question as we go on. 

While not always directly related to our course, I think this is all important food for thought for all of us going forward.
