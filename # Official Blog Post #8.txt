## On our Final Projects: a brief review/stream of consciousness
### After leaving class on Monday (April 4th), I came away fairly impressed with what my colleagues had accomplished, all things considered. However modest of an improvement, we have all come away from this class with skills and ways of thinking that will assist us in (inter)acting in what is now a slightly less uncertain digital landscape. This fact shined through in the projects and in their little successes at explaining and facilitating learning about the tools/methods we've all picked up during the past three months. Not just that, but the interactivity, engagement, and aesthetics of some the projects (see: Emily & Laurel's fantasy adventure, Elise & Phoebe's mystery) both show off our own development and our projects' effectiveness. Not to mention Rob's digital Telephone game involving OCR and audio recognition software. I loved this one on so many levels...

With that said, I was disappointed that we had mostly all made twines as opposed to something different, like Rob's project. We stuck with what was safe. I was also a little concerned that all of our projects were fairly similiar in outlook and format. They don't tend to distinguish themselves too, too much from one another beyond some aesthetic choices and some structural aspects. As well, I worry that we may have accidentally catered to ourselves with our projects, something we criticized the Programming Historian of doing and that we had all wanted to avoid at all costs. I think we may have written tutorials for us and not for a "them." For example, Sara's trivia game really does seem directed at us as a class as opposed to at those who haven't heard of any of what she's talking about. But she's not the only one. Even my own project at times seems to speak in the same way that the Programming Historian does, taking knowledge on the part of the user as a given.

What I'm really interested in after all of this is whether our attempts to introduce digital history to the users of our twines are actually successful, as well as if we can attribute this success to the "engagement" element. I get the sense that I might only appreciate these projects and their faciliation of learning because I am already familiar with the subject matter and because they appear to be an improvement on the more monotonous Programming Historian tutorials. Would these twines be anymore helpful if we got others to test them out? I'm not too sure, to be completely honest... On the other hand I sense that any success we have in converting the uninitiated to the ways of digital history will be due to the interactivity of the twine platform, which, again, cuts through the monotony of the some of the learning process.

In this regard, I am very excited to hold my day-long twitter session covering my, Sara, and Kelly's tutorial game and the two play-testers I'll be sitting down with!
