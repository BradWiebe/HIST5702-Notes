# Markdown Exercise; Brad Wiebe

There are a number of reasons I have decided to take Digital History (HIST5702) a few of which I have listed below:

  - Digital skills for my CV and future employment
  - General Interest in game-making and digital literacy
  - Improving my knowledge of and capacity to navigate the digital world
  - Acquiring a more critical eye for the digital world
  - Fun

My ignorance of programming languages, operating systems, softwares, file formats, etc. etc. etc. weighs on me constantly. Yet I always remember an inspiring quote from a great mind of the 20th century.  As the fictional [Dr. Emmett Brown] [Dr. Emmett Brown] [says] [df1]: > Weight's got nothing to do with it.

! [The way to the Future] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Dmc_de_lorean_1.jpg) "Delorean"

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
