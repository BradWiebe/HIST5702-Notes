## Real World Applicability
### Over the summer I worked as a Research Assistant to a couple of curators at the Canadian Museum of History, both with their own distinct research needs and working styles. I completed a large variety of diverse tasks for the two of them. What I have quickly remarked upon throughout this course is the (in)direct applicability of many different tools and methods that we have come into contact with and at least some areas where I could have saved myself some trouble and improved upon my work/workflow. I'd like to offer up a few concrete examples that have really struck me.

  - WGET: Despite just how obvious the applicability of the wget command is, I feel that mentioning it is quite necessary just for the simple fact that it could have saved me more than a few hours of tedious work. Over the course of my time at the museum I was often called upon to do the data collection, e.g. downloading all of the documents pertinent to Canadian-American-British Foreign Relations during the prohibition era. Simply clicking and saving each individual file from this or that site became a task unto itself and gave me much less time to actually sort through the files themselves.
  - GREP (Counting/Mining Data): Continuing on with the topic of Foreign Relations, the ability to count/search words (on a much larger scale than ctrl+f) may very well have saved me the trouble (and pleasure, if we're being honest) of perusing through the collection of material I had put together. Instead of going through each file individually to do keyword searches, grep would have done it in one fell swoop.
  - Palladio: My favourite example, Palladio could have been very helpful for visualizing the correspondence between the three countries and various types of relationships between actors, diplomats, and the international issues that they were discussing. I had put a lot of work into creating a comprehensive spreadsheet that would have fit very well into the Palladio format and I very much would have liked to see the links that it could have highlighted.

### **HOWEVER** the big problem with all of this is that I likely would not have been allowed to employ many of the various tools or methods that we have tried out in class due to the kind of institutional paternalism and retiecence that we have often discussed. The Museum's software would have prevented me from going ahead with this or that. In fact, I even received calls about my data usage spikes during the collection phase of my work, so unless I attenuated the speed of my wget downloads, this would have been utterly out of the question. So in contemplating the appliability of this course, I am left wondering whether these tools may be all for not in the future, professionally speaking. I suppose it will really depend on the professional and institutional environment I find myself in.
