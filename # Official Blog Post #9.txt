## On the Twitter Essay: an informal review
### Inspired by Leigh Wright's ["Tweet Me A Story"](http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/wright/), I chose to write my [unessay](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay) as a Twitter essay. Using the hashtag #dhWin (digital history on Windows, as well as a digital history WIN), I spent the day tweeting and conversing about Sara, Kelly, and I's final project and its design, goals, paradata (i.e. explanations of our choices and motivations) and so on. In addition to online engagment via twitter, I sat down with two separate playtesters and had them try out the game beside me. They provided me with a stream of consciousness as I live-tweeted their reactions and thoughts. Afterwards, we each engaged in a review of the tutorial and discussion of digital history more generally. Check out the [tutorial](http://www.philome.la/BradWieb3/intro-to-digital-history-for-windows-users) & [twitter coverage](https://storify.com/BradWieb3/intro-to-digital-history-a-live-playtest-5707ce910b4ce8cd0a55bbcc) for yourself.

I believe that taking the process of playtesting onto Twitter was an excellent choice on my part. Although the live-tweeting received less engagement than I had first hoped, interactions over twitter were helpful throughout the process for my thinking through the tutorial and for engaging with the playtesters. But beyond that, working live and in public in this way felt liberating, in a sense: liberating from my own inert and convoluated writing & work process. In public, its do or die. You've got to stay on the move; you've got to keep going. So it was nice to have this extra motivation to work faster and work better than if I was alone in my office writing an essay. As well, creating a public repository ensures that others may have access to my work in the future. The whole thing really jives with many of the themes we have discussed in class around open access, etc.

Unrelated to the project itself, I enjoyed the Twitter essay format because, as Wright suggests, it forces one to be concise and focused in their commentary and arguments. Only the most vital information can survive and you've got to make every character count. The window dressing of longer-form essays is eliminated. And I feel that this format mixes well with how my own brain and way of working function. Impatient? Short attention span? A little lazy but also desire a faster pace? Twitter writing is for you! And in addition to the potential for fruitful public conversations mentioned above, Twitter can offer a leg up in the academic/professional exposure. Though I don't plan on a career in journalism, after this exercise I could easily picture myself utilizing twitter in this regard.

On the flip-side, this exercise turned dark at times too. Extended periods of time on twitter/social media (especially on one's phone) is not advisable. After tweeting the intro, first playthrough, and following conversation I got pretty dizzy from overexposure to my cell phone & laptop. I did not take into account that reading & writing on such a small screen for so long would have such an effect on me and I was lucky to have a little break in between playtests. Finally, and quite unfortunately for someone trying to mitigate my use of social media and my cell, I feel that even this short but intense exposure to twitter deepened my addiction to social media. I am slowly becoming more and more used to functioning and (inter)acting on social media and in a "social media mode." Good or bad? I don't know...
